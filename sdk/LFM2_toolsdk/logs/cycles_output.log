USER: Which one should I care about more?
============================================================
MODEL TOOL CALL: No tool call
MODEL RESPONSE: Deciding which to care about more—weather in Paris or the stock price of AAPL—depends on your current needs and context. Here's a quick guide:

- **If you're planning travel or outdoor activities**: The weather in Paris matters most. Knowing if it's sunny, rainy, or cold helps you prepare appropriately.  
- **If you're investing or tracking market trends**: AAPL's stock price and movement are more relevant, especially if you're monitoring your portfolio or making financial decisions.  
- **If you're simply curious**: Both are valid—weather affects daily life, while stock prices reflect broader economic trends.  

In most daily scenarios, **weather** tends to have a more immediate impact on your plans, while stock prices are better for long-term financial awareness. Choose based on what's most relevant to your current situation!
